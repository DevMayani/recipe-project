  <h3 class="hist">So What's The History Behind Spaghetti Bolognese?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="word">
      <p>It should be noted that the origin of pasta Bolognese does not involve spaghetti at all. <br>
        Instead, the name comes from an initial recipe in Bologna, involving Tagliatelle and a rich rag첫.</p> 
      <p>In Italy, rag첫 is a term used to describe a type of meat sauce that has been cooked for many hours over low heat. Each rag첫 boasts numerous ingredients, which varies from region to region. In fact, "alla bolognese" is only one of the many different rag첫s prepared in Italy.</p>
